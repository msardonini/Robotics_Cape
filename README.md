# Beaglebone QuadCopter with Robotics Cape API
	Quadcopter flight program for Beaglebone Blue or Beaglebone Black with Robotics Cape. 
	Built with StrawsonDesign's Robotics Cape Library http://strawsondesign.com/#!manual-install.
	

## Prereq's

	1. cmake
	2. Eigen

## Install

1. Log in as root (needs to be enabled, https://linuxconfig.org/enable-ssh-root-login-on-debian-linux-server)
  ```
$  cd /root/ 
$  git clone --recursive git@github.com:msardonini/Robotics_Cape.git
$  cd Robotics_Cape/
$  mkdir build
$  cmake ..
$  make install
$  cd ..
$  bash install.sh
```
2. Reboot Beaglebone

## Run Program
	1. SSH into beaglebone
	2. Calibrate esc's (if needed)
	3. Run "nohup flyMS"
	4. Disconnect usb wire if attached
	5. Toggle kill switch twice and leave up to initialize
	6. Fly


## Major Changes from Existing Repo
	1. flyMS flight program
	2. "pru_handler" is a background process which runs on boot. This sends zero commands to the escs while no process is running so esc's stop beeping when powered. It also communicates with programs which send esc commands 
	3. Digital Filter improved, minimum memory dynamically allocated and shifting of timestamps is done in place
	4. The estimation and control library (from PX4) has been stripped down and put into this build for GPS/INS fused navigation
